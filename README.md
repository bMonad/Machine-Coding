# UIQuests

### - Learn Frontent through Quests

A collection of frontend machine-coding projects built with React.js. These small apps and challenges are focused on strengthening logical thinking, problem solving, and practical React skills through hands-on exercises.

## Highlights

- Multiple frontend projects (each in its own folder, e.g. `auto-complete/`)
- Built with React (Vite + React) for fast iteration
- Practical problems that improve component design, state management, and UI/UX thinking

## ✨ Projects

Below is a table of projects included in this repository. "Project" links to the project folder; "Demo" links to a live demo when available (or notes how to run locally).

| Project                          | Demo                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| [Auto-Complete](./auto-complete) | https://weather-app |

> Note: If a demo link is missing, run the project locally:

```bash
cd <project-folder>
pnpm install   # or `npm install` / `yarn`
pnpm dev       # or `npm run dev` / `yarn dev`
```

Open the app in your browser (usually at http://localhost:5173)

## Why this repo

This repository collects short, focused machine-coding tasks intended for:

- Practicing React fundamentals (components, hooks, props, state)
- Improving problem decomposition and logical reasoning
- Building confidence with small, testable UIs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React.js (with Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML & CSS
